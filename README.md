# Regression with Keras
Example of Regression using Neural Network in Keras.
The data can be downloaded from: https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0101EN/labs/data/concrete_data.csv
The code use Neural Network with two dense layers (50 neurons each), ReLu activation, and output dense layer.
The code divided the data to training and validation sets, then calculates the training and validation loss. It also calculate the accuracy and percent error for the validation data. The following figure show the training and validation loss versus epoch.
